##Problem:
================================================================
######Jessie loves candy so much that she buys it from  different stores every day. Her city is located along a number line. It has  buildings,  and each  is located at coordinate . Each building has a candy value of either 0 or 1, where 1 denotes a candy shop and 0 denotes a regular building that does not sell candy. Jessie lives in first building, so the candy value of this location is always 0.######

######Jessie always starts out from her house,  and buys her candies from  different shops. It takes her 1 second to move a distance of 1 unit when her hands are empty; once she makes her first candy purchase, it takes her k seconds to move a distance of 1 unit.######

######Given the candy value of each building in the city, find and print the minimum amount of time needed for Jessie to visit two candy shops if she starts from her house. [More][/problem_statement_Jessie.md "Problem Statement"]
